## Responsive Web Design


### Overview

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)  help people learn to code for free. They create thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available for everyone.

This repository is created to put newly
learn skills to work. By working on this project I got
a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts
that I have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

All of the challenges are done using HTML and CSS.


### Challenges:

This page is dedicated to _Haruki Murakami_ . One of the greatest
contemporary writer and one of my favorite author.
