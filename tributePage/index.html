            <h2>Moment Of Inspiration</h2>
            <p>In 1978 Murakami was in the bleachers of Jingu Stadium watching a
              baseball game between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp when Dave Hilton,
              an American, came to bat. According to an oft-repeated story,
              in the instant that he hit a double,
              Murakami suddenly realized that he could write a novel.
              He went home and began writing that night.</p>

              1973 and A Wild Sheep Chase, which all
              together form “The Trilogy of the Rat.”</p>
